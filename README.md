# Database-Final-Project
A relational database to keep day-to-day records of customers and their purchases, the locations covered by each train, expiry dates of tickets, clerk productivity for reward schemes, the number of passengers per trip, and the companyâ€™s revenue generation.

Functionalities:
The design should enable the following:
- Management to view the most frequent and loyal passengers in a particular time frame to
guide efforts to improve the customer-company relationship.
- Passengers view the start location and final destination for each train
- Management to find out the VIP passengers whose tickets are reaching their expiry dates
to notify them.
- Management would want to reward the most hardworking booking clerk based on the
number of customers they have served.
- Management to track the number of passengers per trip to determine how best to improve
trip scheduling and other services.
- Management to view the amount earned from the various payment types
